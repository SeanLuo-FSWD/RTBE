</p>\n      <p>\n        You are about to read a manifesto on how the fix the increasing wealth\n        gap in the West. This is not an ideological or argumentative piece, but\n        a step-by-step explanation based on logical reasoning and even some\n        simple math. This is done in the hope that we can have common ground and\n        take meaningful action together. Due the scale of the issue, even the\n        simplest logical deduction requires that few common understandings be\n        laid out first, making this a 9000 words piece. So please make yourself\n        comfortable when reading this.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <Element name=\"sec1\" className=\"element\"></Element>\n      <p>Section 1, Introduction:</p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I'd like to start by telling a tale of two nations. A few hundred years\n        ago, China was the wealthiest country on earth, with a GDP accounting\n        for a quarter of the world. But behind its wealthy facade hides a dark\n        secret: 90% of the Chinese are illiterate peasants. The ruling 10% elite\n        have made sure that no peasants are able to read or write, by making the\n        Chinese writing too difficult and time consuming to learn. Unlike\n        English, or any Romanized language, Chinese characters have no\n        connections between how it is written, and how it is read. To become\n        literate, one must memorize the writing and then the pronunciations of\n        hundreds of characters with no discernible pattern. The purpose of the\n        elite was to keep the peasant mass uneducated, uninformed, and unable to\n        rise against them.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Neighbouring China was Japan, who had also adopted the Chinese\n        characters, and whose economy at the time paled in comparison. The\n        Japanese found the Chinese characters too complicated for widespread\n        adoption. Eventually, they used strokes from the Chinese characters to\n        create their own alphabet for writing and pronunciation. Now the\n        Japanese would know how to write a word, if he knows how to speak it,\n        like in English. This seemly trivial improvement was to have huge\n        repercussion later.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When the industrialization came from the West in the 1850s, China was\n        still that country with a 90% mass of illiterate peasants, while the\n        Japanese have literacy rate of about 50%, comparable to the European\n        states. Even more impressively, the Japanese quickly boosted up their\n        literacy rate to 90% as part of its industrialization effort. China,\n        whose writing system is too complicated for widespread adoption, was\n        never able to modernize and was left in the dust.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In those days, a common question amongst the Chinese scholar was to\n        understand how did their country fallen so behind so suddenly? They\n        conclude that their country must have been in decline for a while but\n        couldn’t agree on the cause or symptoms. The problem was there was no\n        sign of decline if we exclusively measure the GDP level, as China had\n        been the world's leading economy for centuries until then.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For me, the decline happened centuries ago, when the elite 10% decided\n        to hold onto power at the expense of the rest. They have created a\n        wealth gap between them and the population, and to maintain that wealth\n        gap, they have engineered a knowledge gap by making everyone illiterate.\n        As such, there were little possibilities for innovation, and when it\n        comes time to industrialize, China simply do not have enough literate\n        people to kickstart the whole process.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When we describe modern America’s decline, we often cite the Roman\n        empire’s collapse, which occurred relatively quickly. But I would say\n        that we are more comparable to that of the Chinese empire, a slow and\n        imperceivable death. The gap between the rich and poor is widening, not\n        just the wealth gap, but a knowledge gap as well. But we don’t see it,\n        and we keep praising our rising GDP and stocks. Sadly, it is always the\n        same mechanism that makes and breaks empires, whether China or Rome.\n        Nations adhere to the principles that made them rich, but these very\n        same principle will also undo them. I so wish that we can learn from\n        history, so at least America can transcend and break this cycle.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Since COVID, many people realized the seriousness of the increasing\n        wealth gap. But no one seems to have a real solution for this. People\n        tend to focus on fixing the symptoms of this issue, such as rising crime\n        rates, homelessness, or housing prices, but not the issue itself. For\n        those who try to tackle wealth inequality directly, their solutions are\n        often aimed to even out wealth distribution through policies that help\n        the poor. This is also a non-solution, as it doesn’t correct the\n        mechanism within capitalism that always leads back to the same\n        problem.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I wrote this manifesto because I am of firm belief to have found the\n        missing piece to end the wealth gap, and I am myself working towards\n        this goal. It offers a unique and comprehensive take on how to fix the\n        issue, from the standpoint of a socially conscientious person with one\n        foot in the tech industry.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <Element name=\"sec2\" className=\"element\"></Element>\n      <p>Section 2, The cause of the problem:</p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a web developer, I spent many hours chasing bugs and fixing broken\n        programs, and developed an appreciation of all the pieces it takes to\n        make a simple website running. In the computer world, either you get it,\n        or you don't. The machine does not care about how much you pray, how\n        popular or confident you are; if you make a mistake, you get slapped\n        with a bug all the same. At the cost of being constantly humbled, I\n        gradually learned to consider a problem from of all its angles and\n        depth.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Unfortunately, this mindset seems to be lacking when it comes to\n        tackling the real-life issue of wealth inequality. The proposed\n        solutions do not take into consideration the comprehensive or subsequent\n        impact they have on the society. Just to give some examples:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>Solution 1: Taxing the rich at a higher rate.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>\n        This solution goes against to the capitalist ideology, which assumes\n        that the rich deserve their wealth because they work harder or smarter.\n        If you are taxing them at a higher rate, aren’t you discouraging hard\n        work and innovation?&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        From a wider perspective, when the tax money goes to fund the social\n        programs for the poor, some undeserving lazy people will benefit. So you\n        are not just discouraging work, but also proportionally encouraging\n        laziness in a way. This chips away at the competitive nature of the\n        society. As laziness induced poverty keeps increasing and the\n        innovations discouraged, even more taxes will be required. By the\n        eventuality of its flawed mechanism, this becomes an addictive\n        self-reinforcing cycle until all incomes from workers gets distributed\n        to even out the wealth gap, like communism where everyone is poor.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On a side note, the top wealth owners do not have income, but instead\n        own assets. Unless the state forcefully takes and sell their asset\n        (which is unlikely), they are not taxable anyway.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>Solution 2: Increase the minimum wage.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>\n        This pushes larger business to further automate, and smaller local\n        business to go bankrupt due to not being able to pay the wages. As\n        result, unemployment increases, making the situation worse overall,\n        while the wealth gap keeps widening.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>Solution 3: Free education for all.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>\n        While in theory this leads to more people having skillful jobs and\n        increase competitiveness, it does not address the fundamental mechanism\n        by which wealth flows to the richest. Skillful or not, employees could\n        still be exploited for profit by the higher up. Or they can themselves\n        become exploiters. This may be a bandage, but not the cure.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On a side note, the millennials are the most educated generation ever in\n        terms of university degrees, and yet the most at risk of unemployment\n        compared to the previous generations.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>Solution 4: Universal basic income.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>\n        This relates a little to the above idea of accessible education. As I\n        recall from the 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang, the idea is\n        that the recipient can now use the extra money to move forward in life,\n        such as attending school or change to a better job. This could be a\n        short-term fix, but still does not solve the fundamental issue. You may\n        have $1000 now to attend night classes, but even your newly acquired\n        skills are still replaceable by robots. You have delayed the\n        eventuality, not stopped it.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I kept hammering on the fact that none of the solutions above address\n        the \"fundamental issue\", and it is time to fully define it for the\n        reader.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        First, a fully descriptive name may be, \"the fundamental issue posed by\n        the capitalistic mechanism\". It can be viewed as an equilibrium problem;\n        the system we have designed is trying to reach an equilibrium state that\n        is unacceptable to us.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We know that wealth begets wealth. If you have extra money, you can use\n        your wealth to generate more wealth by putting it in stocks, which\n        generated a return of 13.6% in the past 10 years (S&amp;P 500). With\n        this return compounded year after year, you will keep growing much\n        richer compared to, say, your neighbour who must work for subsistence\n        with zero financial growth.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        However, in a broader sense your wealth is indirectly made by\n        \"exploiting\" your neighbour to stay poor. To illustrate, he is likely\n        generating much more revenue for the company than what he is paid for.\n        Although this is a general business practice, it could be seen as a form\n        of exploitation given that he is only pay enough to keep working. And if\n        you happen to be invested in this company which keeps growing as result\n        of such, your wealth would be made by indirectly exploiting others.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is basically how stock markets really works to the benefit of the\n        wealthy, by serving as their safekeep for the money made from\n        exploitation. Even during the COVID induced economic downturn, the stock\n        prices are getting so bloated that they seem more like a pyramid scheme\n        than any reflection of the economy.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Despite this, both the president Trump and Biden used the rising stocks\n        as proof that they saved the economy. Don’t they know that the stock\n        market does not include the entire economy, and that they ignored an\n        entire segment of the population? In fact, much of its increase was\n        possible by sacrificing a growing economical class of working-poor who\n        are not even represented in the stock market. That is, the rising stocks\n        themselves are being fueled by the rising wealth gap, as the money from\n        the real-life base economy of the poor is being transferred up into the\n        stock economy of the rich.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To sum up, the one with more resources can continuously acquire more\n        resource generating assets, at the expense of the less resourceful. This\n        is like a game of \"fish eats fish\", where the bigger fish grows by\n        eating smaller ones.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And what is the equilibrium to such a game? You will reach equilibrium\n        when there is only one fish left. This is the real issue I am getting\n        at, is that the capitalistic game we are playing is simply trying to\n        reach its equilibrium point. Therefore, the rich keeps getting richer\n        while the poor getting poorer.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I understand the good intention behind all the proposed solutions above,\n        but the system is not flawed, it is just doing exactly what it is\n        designed to do. Does the game of monopoly end when all players are\n        satisfied with their financial situation? No, it ends when there is only\n        one winner. They might try to keep the game longer by giving out $200\n        cash every time a player passes over the starting point, but the game\n        still will end eventually.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The way I see it, we have started a giant game of monopoly since World\n        War 2. Everyone was having fun in the 50s/60s chasing the American\n        dream. But now the game is nearing the end, we can make out the winners,\n        the trillion-dollar companies like Amazon, Google, or Apple. But what\n        about the losers? Within monopoly, they get booted out of the game\n        board, but in real life this translate to suffering, and an increase in\n        crimes, overdose, and death. The mechanics of capitalism has made us in\n        the 20th century, and is about to unmake us in the 21st century, as it\n        continues towards its equilibrium state.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>Section 3, The impact of the problem:</p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now that I have defined the fundamental issue, it’s time to pin down why\n        is such an equilibrium unacceptable to us. It is unacceptable simply\n        because, the resources are not being shared in an efficient\n        manner.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In economic term, there is such a thing as the diminishing marginal\n        utility of return. Roughly meaning that the more we have of something,\n        the less value we get from it.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Imagine a primitive and simple economy of 10 farmers, where one single\n        farmer can buy 10 plows, and the 9 other farmers cannot buy any. While\n        plows are necessary to loosen the soil to make produce, a single farmer\n        can only operate 1 plow at a time and have no use for the 9 leftover\n        plows. The other nine farmers, meanwhile, could really use the plow and\n        would get much greater utility from it. In such an unevenly distributed\n        economy, the total output would only be equal to that of the one single\n        farmer.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On the other hand, if the resources are distributed evenly with one plow\n        per farmer, then we have achieved the maximum utility. This economy\n        would out-produce the previous one by tenfold, as all 10 farmers are\n        producing at capacity. Throughout the remainder of the article, I will\n        use the term \"efficient\" to describe such an economy. So in the context\n        of this article, whenever I mention \"efficient\", &nbsp;“efficiently”, or\n        “efficiency”, I am referring to this state of wealth distribution where\n        the marginal utility of return is maximized for everyone. Likewise, when\n        I mention the word “sustainable”, it means that the state is moving\n        towards efficiency, not away from it.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And that is just the economic aspect of it, the human aspect would be\n        that the nine farmers, if not given the plow, would not be able to earn\n        a living and thus suffer.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So there you have it, we have come down to the underlying issue. Every\n        time we talk about the wealth disparity, we are essentially referring to\n        the problem of misallocation of resources. It is very important to see\n        the problem this way, as it will be the basis from which I will form my\n        solution.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Text;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport styles from \"./ScrollMenu.module.scss\";\nimport {\n  Link,\n  Element,\n  Events,\n  animateScroll as scroll,\n  scrollSpy,\n  scroller,\n} from \"react-scroll\";\n\nfunction ScrollMenu(prop: any) {\n  function scrollToTop() {\n    scroll.scrollToTop();\n  }\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={\n        prop.mode\n          ? `${styles.scrollMenu}`\n          : `${styles.scrollMenu} ${styles.dark}`\n      }\n    >\n      <p>\n        <Link\n          activeClass=\"active\"\n          className=\"sec1\"\n          to=\"sec1\"\n          spy={true}\n          smooth={true}\n          duration={300}\n        >\n          1. <span>Introduction</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link\n          activeClass=\"active\"\n          className=\"sec2\"\n          to=\"sec2\"\n          spy={true}\n          smooth={true}\n          duration={300}\n        >\n          2. <span>The cause of the problem</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec3\">\n          3. <span>The impact of the problem</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec4\">\n          4. <span>The two obstacles</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec5\">\n          5. <span>The missing link</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec6\">\n          6. <span>The bad state</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec7\">\n          7. <span>The ideal state</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec8\">\n          8. <span>A beautiful world</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec9\">\n          9. <span>The path</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec10\">\n          10. <span>The answer</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"sec11\">\n          11. <span>Conclusion</span>\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p className={`${styles.top}`} onClick={scrollToTop}>\n        Go to Top\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ScrollMenu;\n","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport Navbar from \"../../navbar/Navbar\";\nimport styles from \"./Main.module.scss\";\nimport YouTubeIcon from \"@material-ui/icons/YouTube\";\nimport Switch from \"@material-ui/core/Switch\";\nimport Text from \"./Text\";\nimport ScrollMenu from \"./ScrollMenu\";\n\nfunction Main() {\n  const [lightMode, setLightMode] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setLightMode(!lightMode);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Navbar />\n      <div className={`${styles.banner}`}>\n        <h1>Fixing Wealth Inequality</h1>\n        <h2>The Prosperity Manifesto</h2>\n      </div>\n\n      <section\n        className={\n          lightMode ? `${styles.content}` : `${styles.content} ${styles.dark}`\n        }\n      >\n        <div className={`${styles.options}`}>\n          <div className=\"flex_center\">\n            <p>For the audio version on Youtube, click here </p>\n            <YouTubeIcon className={`${styles.ytbIcon}`} />\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"flex_center\">\n            <p>\n              To switch to {lightMode ? <span>dark</span> : <span>light</span>}{\" \"}\n              mode, click here\n            </p>\n            <Switch\n              checked={lightMode}\n              onChange={handleChange}\n              color=\"default\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className={`${styles.contentGrid}`}>\n          <ScrollMenu mode={lightMode} />\n          <Text />\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Main;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { useLocation, Redirect } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Error from \"../pages/Error/Error\";\nimport { get } from \"lodash\";\n\nconst ErrorHandler = ({ children }: any) => {\n  const location = useLocation();\n  console.log(\"ErrorHandler called\");\n\n  const err_msg = get(location.state, \"errorMsg\");\n\n  let goback_path;\n  let redirect_path;\n\n  if (err_msg) {\n    console.log(\"ErrorHandler found error :\");\n    console.log(err_msg);\n  }\n\n  switch (err_msg) {\n    case \"Forbidden resource\":\n      redirect_path = \"/login\";\n      break;\n\n    default:\n      goback_path = window.location.pathname;\n      redirect_path = \"/error\";\n      break;\n  }\n\n  return err_msg ?
